# Notepad #

Notepad is a simple, easy-to-use note-taking app based upon the tutorial that used to be hosted at
http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/notepad/index.html

This version has a preference to set text size, optional delete confirmation, it can search, sort
your notes in different ways and it has the ability to send the note via e-mail or any other
messenger services.

The notes have a context menu accessed by long-pressing the note title in the list view, and most
screens have an options menu accessed by pressing the 'Menu' button on your Android device.

This project was originally hosted at https://code.google.com/p/banderlabs however that version is
no longer being maintained. This is a clone from the googlecode Archive to allow me to update
it to align better with modern Android devices
